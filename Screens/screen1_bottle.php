<p>Before going to the next step, please have 3 distinct bottled drinks in your proximity. This could be anything from a water bottle, soda bottle, or any drink that you happen to have that is in a bottle. </p>

For example: <br>

<img src="images/spritebottle.jpg" width="30%"> Object 3: <strong>Sprite</strong> <br>

<form action='objects.php' method='post'>
